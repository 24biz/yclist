# YC List

An unofficial list of companies funded by [YCombinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/)


## Contributing

Help keep YC List up-to-date! You can do one or more of the following:

* directly edit [a company data file](https://github.com/linrock/yclist/tree/master/companies) from the browser
* open a [pull request](https://github.com/linrock/yclist/pulls) with edits to company data files
* file [an issue](https://github.com/linrock/yclist/issues) to suggest changes

Each company is listed in an unformatted text file. Only a company name is required. Example company entry:

```
Company Name
  https://www.example.com
  This is a description of the company
  status: exited
  exit: acquired by Example for $1
```
