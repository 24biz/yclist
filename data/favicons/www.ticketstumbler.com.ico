        After nearly three years, TicketStumbler is no more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site had been on life support since the tragic death of my
        co-founder in late 2009. My heart was never in returning to active
        development but I kept the site online because it was useful to a lot of
        people. Most of those people have now gone elsewhere&mdash;and who could
        blame them: there are now <a href="http://seatgeek.com">much better alternatives</a>.
        And I moved on, too. I caught the startup bug again and have already
        begun work on the "<a href="http://swaptitude.com">next big thing</a>."
      </p>
      <p>
        To all those who used TicketStumbler: you unwittingly supported the
        crazy entrepreneurial dream of a couple disenchanted Ohioans, and for
        that I thank you with all my heart. To all our wonderful friends and
        loved ones who provided feedback and support, thanks for making
        TicketStumbler the great product that it was. And to Dan: thanks for
        being the rare sort of friend who'd start such a journey. My one regret
        is you won't be here at the end&mdash;there is still so much road left
        to travel.

        Well at least we took the ride.
